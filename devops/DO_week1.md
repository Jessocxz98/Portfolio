# Hello Cloud World!

## Overview of the week
- You'll work in teams to build and deploy your first containerised application to the Cloud! (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- You will demo your group work on a session that will take place Friday
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build and deploy a containerised web app?**

Finally, you should be also able to understand what the following concepts are and in which ways they are helpful for applications running on the cloud: `logging` and `telemetry`
