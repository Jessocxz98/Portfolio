# Kubernetes (K8s)

## Overview of the week

- There will be a session about Container Orchestration and another one about running K8s locally
- You'll work in teams to build your own K8s cluster using EKS on AWS (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll work on some K8s further challenges with your local clusters
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain and use common Container Orchestration practices with K8s along with listing its main benefits and problem it solves?**
* **Can you diagram the K8s cluster architecture and the different pieces that take part in it?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to build your own EKS cluster?**
* **Can you build your own K8s clusters locally using K3d?**
* **Do you have an understanding of the main differences between running your own K8s cluster locally as opposed to using a service to provision them from AWS?**
