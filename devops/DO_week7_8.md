# Reliability Project

For users to get their jobs done, the system has to be around and working when
they need it. This will be one of your most important responsibilities as an
engineer.

This project will task you with making improvements to a critical system while
also keeping it highly available. You will encounter challenges throughout the
week that will test your skills. In the process, you will gain knowledge, skills
and perspective necessary to do this for real.

## Learning Objectives

* Learn to improve and upgrade a system with minimal compromise to availability.
* Explain the importance of observability in a system.
* Learn to make a system more observable.
* Learn to resolve security issues in a running system.
