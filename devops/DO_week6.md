## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Do I have security in mind when working with applications and incorporating best DevOps practices?**
* **Can I see the benefits of SAST and DAST tools and then incorporate these into a project?**
* **Am I able to get into the shoes of an attacker?**
* **Do I understand the benefits of applying Threat Modelling practices early on within the SDLC?**
* **Am I more proactive now when it comes to raising security concerns?**
* **Do I have a better understanding now of what the security responsibilities of companies and cloud providers are?**
