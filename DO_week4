# Terraform and Azure

## Project overview

- You'll work in teams to set up two separate workflows: one to manage and deploy your infrastructure on Azure using Terraform and another one to deploy an existing application on Azure
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a session about IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Project goals

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain what IaC (Infrastructure as code) is?**
* **Are you able to set an automatic workflow on GitHub Actions to manage your project infrastructure using Terraform?**
* **Can you set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your application on the existing infrastructure on Azure?**
